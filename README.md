Team Project (70%)
Submission deadline: 13th December 2023 at 23:59

Introduction
This project is designed to evaluate the learning objectives of the Database and Analytics Programming module as
outlined below:
LO1: Analyse, compare, contrast and critically evaluate the characteristics of programming languages,
programming environments and database systems commonly utilised for data analytics solution
implementation.
LO2: Critically assess the challenges associated with processing big data datasets and compare and contrast
programming for big data vis-Ã -vis programming for conventional datasets.
LO3: Evaluate tools and techniques for managing the data pipeline and preparing data for further analysis through
data wrangling, cleaning, and validation.
LO4: Critically assess methods and practices for software development in order to design and implement data
programming requirements.
LO5: Evaluate, design and implement solutions for processing datasets by using key programming patterns and
constructs for data analytics, relevant programming languages, and suitable database systems.
